# Intervertebral disc labeling with the [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) approach

## Description

This repository was created to train and test the [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) in a disc labeling context. Depending on the results, the method will ultimately be integrated in our [Disc labeling benchmark](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/disc-labeling-benchmark).
